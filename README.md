## Rules

1. **Starting the Game**: Each player receives ten white cards.
2. **Choosing the Zar**: A random player starts as the Zar and reads the first black card aloud, with blanks.
3. **Selecting White Cards**: All other players choose their favorite white card from their hand.
4. **Revealing Choices**: Once all players have submitted their cards, they are revealed and read in combination with the black card.
5. **Scoring**: The Zar chooses the funniest combination, and the player behind that card receives a point. The next round begins with the next player as Zar.
